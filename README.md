# Snake Game

## Project Description

A classic arcade-style Snake game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project serves as a foundational demonstration of core game development principles and front-end web development skills.

It showcases:

- **Algorithmic Thinking:** Implementation of fundamental game logic for snake movement, dynamic food generation (ensuring no overlap with the snake's body), and robust collision detection (with game boundaries and the snake's own body).

- **Mathematical Concepts:** Practical application of coordinate systems and basic vector movement to manage object positioning and directional updates within the game grid.

- **Responsive Web Design:** Designed with a responsive game canvas and integrated touch controls, ensuring seamless and optimal playability across various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- **Clean Code & UI/UX:** Features a modular and organized codebase with clear separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS variables for styling, and JavaScript for game logic). It provides an intuitive user interface with custom game state messages and a polished visual aesthetic.

This project highlights proficiency in client-side JavaScript development, responsive styling with Tailwind CSS, and a solid understanding of core programming concepts essential for creating interactive web applications.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the game.

- **CSS3:** For styling, utilizing [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) for a maintainable color palette and For styling, and general CSS properties for visual design.

- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For all game logic, interaction, and rendering on the HTML Canvas.
